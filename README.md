# SQL‑Practice‑in‑VS  
*Beginner C# / .NET 8 console app that talks to SQL Server LocalDB*

---

## Project snapshot

I taught myself some basics of C# and .NET over a few evenings, and this is just a demo to show for it. This is also my very first repository made public on GitHub too! 
This repo is the result: a tiny console program that connects to a local SQL Server database, runs a parameterised query, and prints out the results.

**Why it exists**

* Show rapid ramp‑up on the .NET stack (I normally code with Python & SQL).  
* Demonstrate secure database access with `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`.
* Create a fun bite-sized code as a way to showcase my willingness to learn!

**Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akbardenardo/SQL-Practice-in-VS.git
   cd SQL‑Practice‑in‑VS
